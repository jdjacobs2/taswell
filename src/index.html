              Why Buy This Boat?
            </h1>
            <div class="lead pb-3 text-left">

              <p>Taiwan's reknowned boat builder Ta Shing and famed British designer/architect Bill Dixon
                created a true blue water boat endowned with highest quality materials and workmanship.
                Ta Shing is famous for their Nordhavn trawlers as well as Tashiba, Mason, Baba, Panda,
                and Norseman sailboat brands. </p>

              <p>If you are looking at Oysters, Hylas, Passport, Bristol
                or other comparable
                yachts, you will be surpised by the incredible value of the Taswell 49: it's beauty, its
                teak interior, its spacious salon and cabins, its roomy heads with stall showers, its
                cedar lined lockers, its padded vinyl easily removable overhead liner, its satin
                varnished thick teak and spruce cabin sole, its thick solid hand
                layed fiberglass hull, its sound insulated engine compartment, its
                through-bolted stainless steel backed deck hardware, in-mast wire conduits, among
                many other features, all of which insure a luxurious, confortable, safe, sturdy, easily
                maintainable boat throughout the world.
              </p>

              <p>
                The above is true of many Taswell's. But this 30 year old Taswell is special:

                  Aft of the guest cabin and head Windsong boasts its luxurious main salon.
                  Outfitted in the finest teak with exceptional craftmanship,
                  it is incredibly spacious, airy, and bright.
                  Two large overhead hatches, four fixed hull portlights and four long fixed
                  trunk cabin windows provide natural light, while four dome LEDs
                  and four brass cabin lights supply evening illumination. The companionway
                  has a clear Plexiglas sliding hatch that allows additional light to enter
                  the salon. To port is a large oval-shaped bolstered settee upholstered in
                  luxurious fabric that surrounds a formal hi-lo oval teak table (comfortably
                  seats eight for dinner). This large table can be removed (it has its own
                  custom-built storage locker) to reveal a small coffee table that
                  can be lowered for informal gatherings, cocktails or coffee. On
                  the starboard side, two teak and upholstered swivel captain's chairs sit either
                  side of a curved teak pedestal. When inverted, the pedestal's cover provides
                  a secure setting for drinks. Storage inside the pedestal is outfitted for wines and liquors. Two
                  forward outboard cabinets hide stereo speakers and provide storage along with 3 other outboard
                  cabinets.
                  WINDSONG also has a handsome
                  curved teak mast cover that conceals the keel-stepped mast. The companionway can be alternatively
                  closed using three solid teak boards or two screened teak boards. All boards are storable in their
                  custom-designed compartment under the steps.

                    throughout the vessel. Included not only are the sinks in the guest head, the master head,
                    and the galley, but also the three showers: in the guest head, the master head, and the swim
                    platform. There is also an additional pressurized cold fresh water quick connect outlet on the
                    starboard
                    deck adjacent to the cockpit. An
                    Atwood 10.5 gallon water heater, powered by both 110 volts and engine water
                    circulation, provides hot water throughout the vessel, including to
                    the swim platform shower. In addition to the pressurized water system the galley sink has two foot
                    pumps that furnish
                    fresh or salt water respectively.</p>

                  <p>Windsong has three stainless steel water tanks having a total capacity of 200 gallons. Water
                    fills those tanks from three sources. Fresh water can be supplied to the tanks from either a

                  <p> When shore water is not available a 14 gallon per hour top end Spectra Cape Horn watermaker
                    fills more than solves that problem. Its components are split between the engine compartment and

                  <p> A separate high pressure sea water pump supplies water to another quick connect deck outlet
                    near the windless. That water is principally used to wash down the chain and anchor prior
