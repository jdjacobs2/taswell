                and cabins, its roomy heads with stall showers, its cedar lined lockers,
                its padded vinyl easily removable overhead liner. and its statin varnished
                thick teak and spruce cabin sole, to name just a few. Its thick solid hand

                through-bolted stainless steel backed deck hardware, in-mast wire conduits, among

                can be lowered for informal gatherings, cocktails or coffee. On
                the starboard side, two teak and upholstered swivel captain's chairs sit either

                forward outboard cabinets hide stereo speakers and provide storage.  WINDSONG also has a handsome
                curved teak mast cover that conceals the keel-stepped mast.  The companionway can be alternatively
                closed using three solid teak boards or two screened teak boards. All boards are storable in a

                  Proceeding aft past the navigation station you enter owner's stateroom.  It is large and airy. 
                  There is a comfortable centerline island queen-sized berth. Two
                  ports on the transom furnish continuous air circulation throughout the vessel. Two curved
                  ultra-suede settees are positioned on either side of the berth.  On the forward wall a dressing
                  table with an opening table top, a teak trimmed mirror above and swing-out vanity stool
                  below are found.  In addition to a large overhead hatch, three additional portlights and two dorade
                  ventilate the cabin. Lighting includes four brass cabin lights, a large
                  fluorescent light and three overhead LED dome lights. Storage space is extremely
                  generous in this cabin featuring almost 6 feet of cedar-lined hanging lockers, a
                  Formica-lined wet gear locker, and four large drawers (one with security lock). Two in-wall storage lockers
                  plus ample storage under the settees complete the picture.</p>

                  <p>Two coats of Petit epoxy barrier coat and two coats of hard Transocean blue

                  <p>The hull also includes S/S stanchions with double lifelines, six S/S

                    trimmed steering
                    wheel. &nbsp;A custom removable legless teak table provides a

                    dining

                    covered cushions that are removable affixed
                    comfort the cockpit benches.</p>


                  <p>Most importantly the cockpit floor is covered with easily removable
                    teak cockpit grates
                    to help insure that sand and dirt does not reach Windsong's
                    interior. &nbsp;Two
                    cockpit speakers provide music from the stereo at the navigation
                    station.</p>


                  <p>A stainless steel Garhauer motor hoist at the transom provides easily

                    mounts. &nbsp;
                    </p>


                  <p>Deck canvas (color toast) includes a bimini under the solar panels, a
                    connector with
                    strata-glass between the hard dodger and bimini, cockpit side panels
                    with strata-glass,
                    sunbrella cockpit sunshades, wheel/pedestal cover, deck hatch covers,
                    and toe rail
                    covers.</p>


                  <p>The cockpit also has a full complement of navigation equipment. &nbsp;A
                    Garmen 7612
                    chart plotter, two Garmin digital displays, a Garmin autopilot display
                    and control,
                    Garmin wireless autopilot remote control, Lewmar wireless anchor
                    windlass/bow thruster
                    remote control, &nbsp;and Garmin remote wireless VHF handset, are all
                    mounted in the cockpit. </p>


                  <p>A stainless steel folding ladder that stows against the rear transom
                    bulkhead lowers to
                    provide access from the swim platform into the water. &nbsp;The swim
                    platform
                    additionally has a stowable shower head and hose that provides both hot
                    and cold water.
                    &nbsp;A second folding stainless ladder stows against the
                    lifelines and
                    removably mounts amidships to either of the vessel&rsquo;s sides to
                    provide easy access
                    to either a dinghy or the water. The transom ladder provides the advantage of
                    transom steps, yet keeps the vessel's length under 50 feet, permitting lower
                    dockage costs and easier maneuverability. </p>
