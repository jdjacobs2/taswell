              <p>WINDSONG is a superb three stateroom, center cockpit sailing yacht in
                enviable condition, maintained by her owner in turnkey, fully equipped
                ocean
                ready cruising condition. She is a totally custom built blue water sailing
                yacht that can be easily handled from the cockpit and cruised by one
                couple.
                With a keel depth of 5.5 ft and a mast height of 63 ft WINDSONG easily
                navigates the ICW. </p>


              <p>WINDSONG was a fresh-water boat for her first ten years. During their ten
                years the second owner sailed the U.S east coast and the Bahamas. The third
                and present owner lived aboard to experience the U.S. east coast and the entire
                Caribbean, often 2 or more times.  She now looks to conquer the remainder of 
                the world.</p>


              <p>WINDSONG has been continuously upgraded, including virtually all mechanical,
                rigging and electronic systems. &nbsp;Qualified mechanics have 
                professionally performed under owner's close supversion
                all necessary and optional maintenance and upgrades.  She has always been non-smoking 
                and pet free.</p>

              Why Buy This Boat?
            </h1>
            <div class="lead pb-3 text-left">

              <p>Taiwan's reknowned boat builder Ta Shing and famed British designer/architect Bill Dixon
                created a true blue water boat endowned with highest quality materials and workmanship. 
                Ta Shing is famous for their Nordhavn trawlers as well as Tashiba, Mason, Baba, Panda, 
                and Norseman sailboat brands.  If you are looking at Oysters, Hylas, Passport, Bristol 
                or other comparable 
                yachts, you will be surpised by the incredible value of the Taswell 49: it's beauty, its 
                teak interior, its spacious salon and cabins, its roomy heads with stall showers, its 
                cedar lined lockers, its padded vinyl easily removable overhead liner, its satin 
                varnished thick teak and spruce cabin sole, its thick solid hand
                layed fiberglass hull, its sound insulated engine compartment, its
                through-bolted stainless steel backed deck hardware, in-mast wire conduits, among
                many other features, all of which insure a luxurious, confortable, safe, sturdy, easily 
                maintainable boat throughout the world.
              </p>

              <p>
                The above is true of all Taswell's.  But this 30 year old Taswell is special:

                Aft of the guest cabin and head Windsong boasts its luxurious main salon.
                Outfitted in the finest teak with exceptional craftmanship, 
                it is incredibly spacious, airy, and bright.
                Two large overhead hatches, four fixed hull portlights and four long fixed
                trunk cabin windows provide  natural light, while four dome LEDs 
                and four brass cabin lights supply evening illumination. The companionway 
                has a clear Plexiglas sliding hatch that allows additional light to enter 
                the salon.  To port is a large oval-shaped bolstered settee upholstered in
                luxurious fabric that surrounds a formal hi-lo oval teak table (comfortably 
                seats eight for dinner). This large table can be removed (it has its own 
                custom-built storage locker) to reveal a small coffee table that 
                can be lowered for informal gatherings, cocktails or coffee. On
                the starboard side, two teak and upholstered swivel captain's chairs sit either
                side of a curved teak pedestal.  When inverted, the pedestal's cover provides
                a secure setting for drinks. Storage inside the pedestal is outfitted for wines and liquors. Two
                forward outboard cabinets hide stereo speakers and provide storage along with 3 other outboard cabinets.  
                WINDSONG also has a handsome
                curved teak mast cover that conceals the keel-stepped mast.  The companionway can be alternatively
                closed using three solid teak boards or two screened teak boards. All boards are storable in their
                custom-designed compartment under the steps.

                  Proceeding aft past the navigation station you enter owner's stateroom.  It is large and airy. 
                  There is a comfortable centerline island queen-sized berth. Two

                  table with an opening table top, a teak trimmed mirror above and swing-out vanity stool
                  below are found.  In addition to a large overhead hatch, three additional portlights and two dorades
                  ventilate the cabin. Lighting includes four brass cabin lights, a large
