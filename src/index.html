            <p>WINDSONG is a superb three stateroom, center cockpit sailing yacht in
               enviable condition, maintained by her owner in turnkey, fully equipped
               ocean
               ready cruising condition. She is a totally custom-built blue-water sailing
               yacht that can be easily handled from the cockpit and cruised by one
               couple.
               With a keel depth of 5.5 ft and a mast height of 63 ft WINDSONG easily
               navigates the ICW. </p>


            <p>WINDSONG was a fresh-water boat for her first ten years. During their ten
               years the second owner sailed the U.S east coast and the Bahamas. The third
               and present owner also covered the U.S. east coast and the entire
               Caribbean, often 2 or more times.
               &nbsp;WINDSONG has always been a non-smoking, no-pets, and no-shoes below
               deck yacht!</p>


            <p>WINDSONG has been continuously upgraded to where virtually all mechanical,
               rigging and electronic systems, save the engine and generator, are less 8
               years old. &nbsp;Qualified mechanics have diligently professionally perform
               all necessary and optional maintenance and upgrades.</p>
